# Change log

## Unreleased

* It is now possible to have nested model ops on belongs_to relations
  with explicit class_name.

## 1.0.10 (2019-07-23)

* Fix `defined?` calls in controller mixin so that the mixin can be used without
  defining `current_user` or `current_ability`.

## 1.0.9 (2019-05-29)

* Changes to development setup

## 1.0.8 (2019-05-29)

* Fix #14 Policy chain `after_perform` is never called.

## 1.0.7 (2019-04-25)

* It is now possible to add a policy in front of the policy chain
  instead of the end. It is however not guaranteed to be the first policy to be
  run since multiple policies can be prepended to the chain.  A prepended policy
  can't access the operation model, since it is not set yet.

  See PR#12.

## 1.0.6 (2019-04-10)

* Fix automatic controller mixin introduced in 1.0.4. Including the mixin into
  `ApplicationController` lead to random user-defined helpers not being loaded
  anymore. The mixin is now included into `ActionController::Base` instead.

## 1.0.5 (2019-04-09)

* Add missing controller mixin automatically so that no (undocumented) manual
  include is necessary.

## 1.0.4 (2019-04-03)

* Add global option `config.trigger_hookups_without_authorization` (defaults to
  `true` to be compatible with previous versions)

## 1.0.3 (2019-03-18)

* Add missing imports of required third-party gems

* Add policy chain `before_model_save` for model operations

* Add policy chain `before_nested_model_ops` for model operations

* If existing, use `ActiveSupport::ParameterFilter` over
  `ActionDispatch::Http::ParameterFilter` which is deprecated in Rails 6

* Fix error catching of nested model operations

* Fix error handling of sub operations

* Add `view` to operation contexts that contains the `view_context`. Only use
  this for frontend operations that are always called from within a controller.

* Expose `op_context` as a view helper method. This is useful for instantiating
  new (view) operations from within views and helpers.

## 1.0.2 (2019-01-29)

* Fix mass assignment protection errors under Rails 3

## 1.0.1 (2019-01-29)

* Fix reliance on `ActionController::Parameters`. Now the strong parameter
  check is only enforced if `ActionController::Parameters` actually exists.

* Fix missing `require`

* Fix compatibility with ruby < `2.3.0`

## 1.0.0 (2019-01-23)

* First stable release after being battle-tested over an extended period of
  time.

## Prior to 1.0.0 (beta releases)

### 1.0.0.beta15 (2018-12-11)

* Add method `authorize_called!` to manually mark authorization as called for a
  specific operation.

### 1.0.0.beta14 (2018-11-29)

* Fix bug with jRuby 9.2 where operation class name got mutated when inspecting
  it (see https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/5480).

### 1.0.0.beta13 (2018-10-15)

* Explain how to setup load paths in readme

### 1.0.0.beta12 (2018-08-14)

* Exclude param named `escape` from `op_params`.

### 1.0.0.beta11 (2018-07-31)

* Exclude param named `_` from `op_params`. This allows to use `cache: false`
  with `jQuery.ajax`.

### 1.0.0.beta10 (2018-07-18)

* Allow model name override for all models using `RailsOps::ModelMixins`. This
  means you can also specify a model name for models not inheriting from
  `RailsOps::VirtualModel`, i.e.:

  ```ruby
  model User, 'ModelNameOverride'
  ```

### 1.0.0.beta9 (2018-07-04)

* Keep stack trace on exceptions rethrown by `with_rollback_on_exception`.

### 1.0.0.beta8 (2018-05-15)

* Make sure that original state is always restored after calling
  `RailsOps.without_authorization`, even in case of an exception.

### 1.0.0.beta7 (2017-12-19)

* #2 Get rid of protected attributes functionality

### 1.0.0.beta6 (2017-11-27)

### 1.0.0.beta4 (2017-11-16)

* Fix a bug where nested models are saved at build time in update operations in
  some cases.

### 1.0.0.beta3 (2017-09-20)

* Fixed log subscription

### 1.0.0.beta2 (2017-09-20)

* Added rubygems badge to readme

* Initial version as extracted from project

* Start of change log
