[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/rails_ops.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/rails_ops)

rails_ops
=========

This Gem introduces an additional service layer for Rails: *Operations*. An
operation is in most cases a *business action* or *use case* and may or may not
involve one or multiple models. Rails Ops allows creating more modular
applications by splitting them up into their different operations. Each
operation is specified in a single, testable class.

To achieve this goal, this Gem provides the following building blocks:

- Various operation base classes for creating operations with a consistent
  interface and no boilerplate code.

- A way of abstracting model classes for a specific business action.

Requirements & Installation
---------------------------

### Requirements

- RailsOps only works with Rails applications and has been tested with Rails >=
  5.0.
- Prior Rails versions may be supported but this has not been verified.
- Rails Ops' model operations require ActiveRecord but are database / adapter
  agnostic

### Installation

1. Add the following to your Rails application's `Gemfile`:

   ```ruby
   gem 'rails_ops'
   ```

2. Create an initializer file `config/initializers/rails_ops.rb` with the
   following contents:

   ```ruby
   RailsOps.configure do |config|
     # Replace this with your authorization backend.
     config.authorization_backend = 'RailsOps::AuthorizationBackend::CanCanCan'
   end
   ```

3. Optional: If you want your operations to reside inside of `app/operations`
   and be scoped correctly, create the directory `app/operations` and add the
   following inside of the `Application` class within your
   `config/application.rb`:

   ```ruby
    config.paths = Rails::Paths::Root.new(Rails.root)
    config.paths.add 'app/models', eager_load: true
    config.paths.add 'lib', eager_load: true
    config.paths.add 'app', eager_load: true
    ```

Operation Basics
----------------

### Placing and naming operations

- Operations generally reside in `app/operations` and can be nested using
  various subdirectories. They're all inside of the `Operations` namespace.

- Operations operating on a specific model should generally be namespaced with
  the model's class name. So for instance, the operation `Create` for the `User`
  model should generally live under `app/operations/user/create.rb` and
  therefore should be called `Operations::User::Create`.

- Operations inheriting from other operations should generally be nested within
  their parent operation. See the next section for more details.

- Operation classes should always be named after an *action*, such as `Create`,
  `MoveToPosition` and so on. Do not name an operation something like
  `UserCreator` or `CreateUserOperation`.

#### Heads-up: Correct namespacing

As explained in the previous section, operations should be namespaced properly.
Operations can either live within a module or within a class. In most cases,
operations are placed in the `Operation` module or rather one of its
sub-modules. If, in some special case, operations are nested, they can reside
inside of another operation class (but not inside of its file) as well.

When declaring an operation within a namespace,

- Determine whether the namespace you're using is a module or a class. Make sure
  you don't accidentally redefine a module as a class or vice-versa.

- If the operation resides within a module, make a module definition on the
  first line and the operation class on the second. Example:

  ```ruby
  module Operations::Frontend::Navigation
    class DetermineActionsForStructureElement < RailsOps::Operation
      ...
    end
  end
  ```

- If the operation resides within a class, use a single-line definition:

  ```ruby
  class Operations::User::Create::FromApi < Operations::User::Create
    ...
  end
  ```

Note that, when defining a namespace of which a segment is already known as a
(model) class, you cannot just use the model classes name to refer to it:

  ```ruby
  module Operations::User
    class Create < RailsOps::Operation
      def perform
        # This DOES NOT work as `User` in this case refers to the module of
        # the same name defined on the first line of code.
        User.create(params)

        # This works as it takes an absolute namespace:
        ::User.create(params)
      end
    end
  end
  ```

### Basic operations

Every single operation follows a few basic principles:

- They inherit from {RailsOps::Operation}.

- They are called using the `run` or `run!` methods.

- They are parameterized using a `params` hash (and nothing else).

- They define a protected `perform` method which actually executes the
  operation. This is usually overridden in each operation and called exclusively
  by `run` or `run!`.

- They have a *Context*. See the respective chapter for more information.

So, an example of a very simple operation would be:

```ruby
class Operations::PrintHelloWorld < RailsOps::Operation
  def perform
    puts "Hello #{params[:name]}"
  end
end
```

### Running operations manually

There are various ways of instantiating and running an operation. The most
basic way is the following:

```ruby
op = Operations::PrintHelloWorld.new(name: 'John Doe')
op.run
```

There is even a shortcut for this:

```ruby
Operations::PrintHelloWorld.run(name: 'John Doe')
```

### Validations, `run` and `run!`

As you have noticed, there are two methods for running operations: `run` and
`run!`. They behave exactly like `save` and `save!` of ActiveRecord: While the
`run!` method raises an exception if there is a validation error, `run` would
just return `false` (or `true` on success). As not every operation deals with
models or ActiveRecord models, `run` does not only catch the
`ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` exception but also every exception that derives
from {RailsOps::Exceptions::ValidationFailed}.

#### Catching custom exceptions in `run`

If you'd like to catch a custom exception if the operation is called using
`run`, you can either derive this exception from
{RailsOps::Exceptions::ValidationFailed} or else override the
`validation_errors` method:

```ruby
class Operations::PrintHelloWorld < RailsOps::Operation
  # Returns an array of exception classes that are considered as validation
  # errors.
  def validation_errors
    super + [SomeCustomException]
  end
end
```

### Returning data from operations

All operations have the same call signatures: `run` always returns `true` or
`false` while `run!` always returns the operation instance (which allows easy
chaining). If you need to access data that has been generated / processed /
fetched in the operation, create custom accessor methods:

```ruby
class Operations::GenerateHelloWorld < RailsOps::Operation
  attr_reader :result

  def perform
    @result = "Hello #{params[:name]}"
  end
end

puts Operations::GenerateHelloWorld.run!(name: 'John Doe').result
```

Params Handling
---------------

## Passing params to operations

Each single operation can take a `params` hash. Note that it does not have to be
in any relation with `ActionController`'s params - it's just a plain ruby hash
called `params` (in fact, it is a `Object::HashWithIndifferentAcces`, more on
that later).

Params are assigned to the operation via their constructor:

```ruby
Operations::GenerateHelloWorld.new(foo: :bar)
```

If no params are given, an empty params hash will be used. If a
`ActionController::Parameters` object is passed, it will be permitted using
`permit!` and converted into a regular hash.

## Accessing params

For accessing params within an operation, you can use `params` or `osparams`.
While `params` directly returns the params hash, `osparams` converts them into
an `OpenStruct` first. This allows easy access using the 'dotted notation':

```ruby
def perform
  # Access a param using the `params` method
  params[:foo]

  # Access a param using the `osparams` method
  osparams.foo
end
```

Note that both `params` and `osparams` return independent, deep duplicates of
the original `params` hash to the operation, so the hashes do not correspond.

The hash accessed via `params` is a always `Object::HashWithIndifferentAccess`.

## Validating params

You're strongly encouraged to perform a validation of the parameters passed to
an operation. This can be done in several ways:

- Manually using a *policy* (see chapter *Policies*):

  ```ruby
  class Operations::PrintHelloWorld < RailsOps::Operation
    policy do
      unless osparams.name && osparams.name.is_a?(String)
        fail 'You must supply the "name" argument.'
      end
    end

    def perform
      puts "Hello #{params[:name]}"
    end
  end
  ```

- Using a [schemacop](https://github.com/sitrox/schemacop) schema:

  ```ruby
  class Operations::PrintHelloWorld < RailsOps::Operation
    schema do
      req :name, :string
    end

    def perform
      puts "Hello #{params[:name]}"
    end
  end
  ```

  This is the preferred way of performing basic params validation when not using
  model validation (see next item).

  See documentation of the Gem `schemacop` for more information on how to
  specify schemata.

- Using a business model (see chapter *Model Operations*).

Policies
--------

Policies are nothing more than blocks of code that run either at operation
instantiation or before / after execution of the `perform` method and can be
used to check conditions such as params or permissions.

Policies are specified using the static method `policy`, inherited to any
sub-classes and executed in the order they were defined.

```ruby
class Operations::PrintHelloWorld < RailsOps::Operation
  policy do
    puts 'This runs first'
  end

  policy do
    puts 'This runs second'
  end

  def perform
    puts 'This runs third'
    puts 'Oh, and hello world'
  end
end
```

The basic idea of policies is to validate input data (the `params` hash) or
other conditions such as authorizations or locks.

Some checks might still need to be performed directly within the `perform`
method. Use policies as much as possible though to keep things separated.

The return value of the policies is discarded. If a policy needs to fail, raise
an appropriate exception.

### Policy chains

As mentioned above, policies can be executed at various points in your
operation's lifecycle. This is possible using *policy chains*:

- `:on_init`

  Policies in this chain run after the operation class is instantiated.

- `:before_perform`

  Policies in this chain run immediately before the `perform` method is called.
  Obviously this is never called if the operation is just instantiated and never
  run. This is the default chain.

- `:before_model_save`

  This only applies to operations deriving from `RailsOps::Operation::Model` and
  its descendants. Policies in this chain run after nested model operations are
  performed immediately before the "main" model is saved.

- `:before_nested_model_ops`

  This only applies to operations deriving from `RailsOps::Operation::Model` and
  its descendants. Policies in this chain run after nested model operations are
  performed before performing any nested model operations.

- `:after_perform`

  Policies in this chain run immediately after the `perform` method is called.
  Obviously this is never called if the operation is just instantiated and never
  run. Also, this does not run if an exception occurs while performing the
  operation.

The policy chain (default is `:before_perform`) can be specified as the first
argument of the `policy` class method:

```ruby
class MyOp
  policy :on_init do
    puts 'This is run once the operation has been instantiated.'
  end

  policy do
    puts 'This is run before the operation is performed.'
  end
end
```

The order inside the same policy chain depends on the time when a block was added.
You can prepend an action to a policy chain by setting `:prepend_action` to `true`:

```ruby
class MyOp
  policy :on_init, prepend_action: true do
    puts 'This is run first the operation has been instantiated.'
  end
```

In this case the model is not yet set. That will happen later in the `:on_init` chain.
It is also important to note, that this block is
not guaranteed to be run first in the chain, if multiple blocks have set `:prepend_action` to true.


Calling sub-operations
----------------------

It is possible and encouraged to call operations within operations if necessary.
As the basic principle is to create one operation per business action, there are
cases where nesting operations can be very beneficial.

Let's say we have an operation `User::Create` that creates a new user. The
operation should also assign the newly created user to a default `Group` after
creation. In this case, we basically have two separate operations that should
not be combined in one. For this case, use sub-operations:

```ruby
class Operations::User::Create < RailsOps::Operation
  def perform
    user = User.create(params)
    run_sub! AssignToGroup, user: user, group: Group.default
  end
end
```

Every operation offers the methods {RailsOps::Mixins::SubOps.run_sub},
{RailsOps::Mixins::SubOps.run_sub!} and {RailsOps::Mixins::SubOps.sub_op}. The
latter one just instantiates and returns a sub operation.

So why don't we just create and call the sub-operation directly? The reason lies
within the context that is automatically adapted and passed to the sub-operation
and enables to maintain the complete call stack and allows to pass on context
information such as the current user.

### A note on validations

As always when calling operations, you can decide whether an execution should
raise an exception on validation errors or else just return `false` by using the
bang or non-bang methods.

For nested operations, we must give this fact a little more thought. Consider
the following case:

- Operation *A* is called using `run`.
- Operation *A* calls operation *B* using `run_sub!`.
- Operation *B* throws a validation exception.

In this case, it is now expected that *A* returns non-gracefully, even though
it's called using the non-bang method. The reason is that *A* explicitly used
the bang-method for calling the sub-op.

However, as calling *A* catches any validation errors, it will also catch the
validation errors raised by a sub-operation. For this case, calling `run_sub!`
catches any validation errors and re-throws them as
{RailsOps::Exceptions::SubOpValidationFailed} which is not caught by the
surrounding op.

Contexts
--------

Most operations make use of generic parameters like the current user or an
authorization ability. Sure this could all be passed using the `params` hash,
but as this would have to be done for every single operation call, it would be
quite cumbersome.

For this reason Rails Ops provides a feature called *Contexts*. Contexts are
simple instances of {RailsOps::Context} that may or may not be passed to
operations. Contexts can include the following data:

- A user object

  This is meant to be the user performing the operation. In a controller
  context, this usually referred to as `current_user`.

- The session object

  This is the rails `session` object (can be nil).

- An ability object

  This is an ability object (i.e. cancan(can)) which holds the permissions
  currently available. This is used for authorization within an operation.

- The operations chain

  The operations chain contains the call stack of operations. This is
  automatically generated when calling a sub-op or triggering an op using an
  event (see chapter *Events* for more information on that).

- URL options

  Rails uses a hash named `url_options` for generating URLs with correct prefix.
  This information usually comes from a request and is automatically passed to
  the operation context when calling an operation from a controller. This hash
  is used by {RailsOps::Mixins::Routes}.

- View context

  If the operation has been created from within a controller, the property
  `view` includes the current view context. Only use this for frontend
  operations that will always be called from a controller.

- Called via hook

  `called_via_hook` is a boolean indicating whether or not this operation was
  called by a hook (true) or by a regular method call (false). We will introduce
  hooks below.

### Instantiating contexts

Contexts behave like a traditional model object and can be instantiated in
multiple ways:

```ruby
context = Context.new(user: current_user, params: { foo: bar })

# Another way
context = Context.new
context.user = current_user
```

### Feeding contexts to operations

Contexts are assigned to operations via the operation's constructor:

```ruby
my_context = RailsOps::Context.new
op = Operations::PrintHelloWorld.new(my_context, foo: :bar)
```

For your convenience, contexts also provide `run` and `run!` methods:

```ruby
my_context.run Operations::PrintHelloWorld, foo: :bar
```

### Sub-operations

When calling a sub-operation either using the corresponding sub-operation
methods or else using events, a new context is automatically created and
assigned to the sub-operation. This context includes all the data from the
original context. Also, the operations chain is automatically complemented with
the parent operation.

This is called *context spawning* and is performed using the
{RailsOps::Context.spawn} method.

Hooks
-----

In some cases, certain actions must be hooked in after execution of an
operation. While this can certainly be done with sub-operations, it is not
always desirable as the triggering operation should not always know of the
additional ones it's triggering:

- `Operations::User::Create` creates a user, but also creates a group object
  using `Operations::Group::Create`. *This is an example for sub-ops*.

- `Operations::User::Create` creates a user. Whenever a user is created, another
  part of the application needs to generate a todo for the admin to approve this
  user. *This would be an example for hooks*.

Hooks are pretty simple: Using the file `config/hookup.rb`, you can
specify which operations should be triggered after which operations. These
operations are then automatically triggered after the original operation's
`perform` (in the `run` method).

### Defining hooks

Hooks are defined in a file named `config/hookup.rb` in your local application.
In development mode, this file is automatically reloaded on each request so
there is no need to restart the application server for this while developing.

Defining hooks is as simple as defining a target operation and one or more
source operations.

```ruby
RailsOps.hookup.draw do
  run Operations::Notifications::User::SendWelcomeEmail do
    on Operations::User::Create
  end

  run Operations::Todos::GenerateUserApprovalTodo do
    on Operations::User::Create
  end

  run Operations::Notification::SendTodoNotification do
    on Operations::Todos::GenerateUserApprovalTodo
  end
end
```

Operations hooks are always performed in the order they are defined.

### Events

Each operation can throw different *events*. The event `:after_run` is
automatically triggered after each operation's execution and should be
sufficient for most cases. However, it is also possible to trigger custom events
in the `perform` method:

```ruby
def perform
  trigger :custom_event_name, { some: :params }
end
```

This can be hooked by specifying the custom event name in your hookup
configuration:

```ruby
on Operations::User::Create, :custom_event_name do
  perform Operations::Notifications::User::SendWelcomeEmail
end
```

In most cases though, situations like these should rather be handled by
explicitly calling a sub-operation.

### Hook parameters

For each hook that is called, at set of parameters is passed to the respective
operations. When calling events manually (see section *Events*), you can
manually specify the parameters. For the default event `:after_run`, the set of
parameters is defined by the operation method `after_run_trigger_params`. In the
default case, this returns an empty array. Some operation base classes, like for
instance `RailsOps::Operation::Model`, override this method to supply a custom
set of parameters. See your respective base class for more information.

Be advised: It is not usually desirable to provide a very custom param set that
is tailored to one particular target operation. Trigger parameters should be as
generic as possible as specific cases should rather be handled using sub-ops.

Operations can be used to write adapters (*glue* operations) in order to hook
into an operation with incompatible parameters. Create a glue operation that
hooks into the source operation and prepares the params specifically for the
target operation, which is then called using a sub-operation or the hooking
system.

### Check if called via hook

You can determine whether your operation has been (directly) called via a hook
using the `called_via_hook` context method:

```ruby
def perform
  puts 'Called via hook' if context.called_via_hook
end
```

Note that this property never propagates, so when calling a sub-operation from
an operation that has been called using a hook, `called_via_hook` of the
sub-operation is set to `false` again.

### Authorization

Operations called via hooks perform normal authorization per default. You can
turn this off by switching off the gobal option
`config.trigger_hookups_without_authorization`.

Authorization
-------------

Rails Ops offers backend-agnostic authorization using so-called
*authorization backends*.

Authorization basically happens by calling the method `authorize!` (or
`authorize_only!`, more on that later) within an operation. What exactly this
method does depends on the *authorization backend* specified.

### Authorization backends

Authorization backends are simple classes that supply the method `authorize!`.
This method, besides the operation instance, can take any number of arguments
and is supposed to perform authorization and raise if the authorization failed.

The authorization backend can be configured globally using the
`authorization_backend` configuration setting, which can be set to the name of
your backend class.

Example initializer:

```ruby
RailsOps.configure do |config|
  config.authorization_backend = 'RailsOps::AuthorizationBackends::CanCanCan'
end
```

RailsOps ships with the following backend:

- `RailsOps::AutorizationBackend::Cancancan`

  Offers integration of the `cancancan` Gem (which is a fork of the `cancan`
  Gem).

### Performing authorization

Authorization is generally performed by calling `authorize!` in an operation.
The arguments, along with the operation instance, are passed on to the
`authorize!` method of your authorization backend. Basically, you can call
`authorize!` anywhere in your operation, but bear in mind that if your
authorization requires certain data (i.e. the `params` hash), your authorization
calls should occur *after* that certain data is available.

```ruby
class MyOp < RailsOps::Operation
  def perform
    authorize! :read, :some_area
  end
end
```

Usually though, authorization, as other pre-conditions, are called within
policies:

```ruby
class MyOp < RailsOps::Operation
  policy do
    authorize! :read, :some_area
  end
end
```

In many cases, you'd like the authorization to run no matter if the operation
ever runs. For this case, use the `:on_init` policy chain:

```ruby
class MyOp < RailsOps::Operation
  policy :on_init do
    authorize! :read, osparams.some_record
  end
end
```

See section *Policy chains* for more information.

### Ensure that authorization has been performed

As it is a very common programming mistake to mistakenly omit calling
authorization, Rails Ops offers a solution for making sure that authorization
has been called in every operation.

This is done by calling `ensure_authorize_called!` on your operation. This will
raise an exception if no authorization has been performed. This method is
automatically called in `run` or `run!` after the execution of the `perform`
method.

This method only applies if authorization is currently enabled (see next
section), otherwise it does nothing.

It is implemented so that every call to `authorize!` sets an instance variable
of the respective operation to `true`, and `ensure_authorize_called!` checks
this instance variable on calling.

Sometimes you might want to call authorization that should not count for this
check, i.e. some base authorization that needs to be complemented with some
specific authorization code. In these cases, use `authorize_only!`:

```ruby
def perform
  authorize_only! :foo, :bar

  # The following will fail as authorize_only! calls do not count as authorized.
  ensure_authorize_called!
end
```

This method otherwise does exactly the same as `authorize!` (in fact, it's the
underlying method used by it).

### Disabling authorization

Sometimes you don't want a specific operation to perform authorization, or you
don't want to perform any authorization at all.

For this reason, Rails Ops allows you to disable authorization globally, per
operation or per operation call (i.e. an operation should generally perform
authorization, but not in a specific case). If authorization is disabled, all
calls to `authorize!` won't have any effect and will never fail. Also, it is not
ensured that authorization has been performed as it would always fail (see
previous section).

Rails Ops offers multiple ways of disabling authorization:

- By not configuring any authorization backend.

- By calling the class method `without_authorization`:

  ```ruby
  class MyOp < RailsOps::Operation
    without_authorization
  end
  ```

  If the operation is invoked using controller integration, this also disables
  the controller-side check that makes sure an authorization method is called.

  This does not disable authorization for any sub operations. See the next
  section for information on how to disable sub operation authorization.

- By invoking one or more operations in a `RailsOps.without_authorization`
  block:

  ```ruby
  RailsOps.without_authorization do
    # Authorization will be disabled even if `SomeOperation` itself would
    # otherwise perform authorization.
    SomeOperation.run
  end
  ```

  Within operations, you can also use the instance method
  `without_authorization` which does the same thing as the global one (it is
  just a shortcut and can therefore be used interchangeably):

  ```ruby
  class MyOp < RailsOps::Operation
    def perform
      without_authorization do
        run_sub! SomeOtherOperation
      end
    end
  end
  ```

  Note that when calling `without_authorization` this does not only apply to
  other operations called, but also to the operation you're currently in:

  ```ruby
  class MyOp < RailsOps::Operation
    def perform
      without_authorization do
        # The following line does nothing, as authorization is currently
        # disabled.
        authorize! :read, :some_area
      end
    end
  end
  ```

Model Operations
----------------

One of the key features of RailsOps is model operations. RailsOps provides
multiple operation base classes which allow convenient manipulation of active
record models.

All of the model operation classes, including more specialized base classes,
inherit from {RailsOps::Operation::Model} (which in turn inherits from
{RailsOps::Operation} as every operation base class).

The key principle behind these model classes is to associate *one model class*
and *one model instance* with a particular operation.

### Setting a model class

Using the static method `model`, you can assign a model class that is used in
the scope of this operation.

```ruby
class SomeOperation < RailsOps::Operation::Model
  model User
end
```

You can also directly extend this class by providing a block. If given, this
will automatically create a new, anonymous class that inherits from the given
base class and run the given block in the static context of this class:

```ruby
class SomeOperation < RailsOps::Operation::Model
  model User do
    # This code only runs in a dynamically created subclass of `User` and does
    # not affect the original model class.
    validates :name, presence: true
  end
end
```

You do not even have to specify a base class. In this case, the class returned
by the static method `default_model_class` (default: {ActiveType::Object}) will
be used as base class:

```ruby
class SomeOperation < RailsOps::Operation::Model
  model do
    # See ActiveType documentation for more information on virtual attributes.
    attribute :name
  end
end
```

### Obtaining a model instance

Model instances can be obtained using the *instance* method `model`, which is
not to be confused with the *class* method of the same name. Other than the
class method, the instance method instantiates and returns a model object with
the type / base class specified using the `model` class method:

```ruby
class SomeOperation < RailsOps::Operation::Model
  model User

  def perform
    # This returns an instance of the 'User' class. To be precise: This example
    # does not work out-of-the-box as this base class is abstract and does not
    # implement the `build_model` method. But more on that later.
    model
  end
end
```

The instance method `model` only instantiates a model once and then caches it in
the instance variable `@model`. Therefore, you can call `model` multiple times
and always get back the same instance.

If no cached instance is found, one is built using the instance method
`build_model`. Note that this method is not provided by the `Model` base class
but only implemented in its subclasses. You can implement and override this
method to your liking though.

### Loading models

Using the base operation class {RailsOps::Operation::Model::Load}, a model can
be loaded. This is done by implementing the `build_model` mentioned above. In
this particular case, the `find` method of the statically assigned model class
is used in conjunction with an ID extracted from the operation's params.

```ruby
class Operations::User::Load < RailsOps::Operation::Model::Load
  model User
end

op = Operations::User::Load.run!(id: 5)
op.model.id # => 5
```

Note that this base class is a bit of a special case: It does not provide a
`perform` method and does not need to be run at all in order to load a model.
This is very useful when, for example, displaying a form based on a model
instance without actually performing any particular action such as updating a
model.

Therefore, the above example would also work as follows:

```ruby
# The operation does not have to be performed to access the model instance.
op = Operations::User::Load.new(id: 5)
op.model.id # => 5
```

#### Specifying ID field

Per default, the model instance is looked up using the field `id` and the ID
obtained from the method params using `params[:id]`. However, you can customize
this field name by overriding the method `model_id_field`:

```ruby
class Operations::User::Load < RailsOps::Operation::Model::Load
  model User

  def model_id_field
    :some_other_id_field
  end
end
```

#### Locking

In most cases when you load a model, you might want to lock the corresponding
database record. RailsOps is configured to automatically perform this locking
at time of loading. However, you can override the default behavior using
the option {RailsOps.config.lock_models_at_build}.

This behavior can also be overwritten per operation using the
`lock_model_at_build` class method:

```ruby
class Operations::User::Update < RailsOps::Operation::Model::Update
  model ::User
  lock_model_at_build false # Takes `true` if no argument is passed
end
```

### Creating models

For creating models, you can use the base class
{RailsOps::Operation::Model::Create}.

This class mainly provides an implementation of the methods `build_model` and
`perform`.

The `build_model` method builds a new record using the operation's parameters.
See section *Parameter extraction for create and update* for more information on
that.

The `perform` method saves the record using `save!`.

```ruby
class Operations::User::Create < RailsOps::Operation::Model::Create
  schema do
    req :user do
      opt :first_name
      opt :last_name
    end
  end

  model User
end
```

As this base class is very minimalistic, it is recommended to fully read and
comprehend its source code.

#### Overriding the perform method

While in many cases there is no need for overriding the `perform` method, this
can be useful i.e. when assigning or altering properties manually:


```ruby
def perform
  model.some_value = 42
  model.first_name.upcase!
  super # Saves the record
end
```

### Updating models

For updating models, you can use the base class
{RailsOps::Operation::Model::Update} which is an extension of the `Load` base
class.

This class mainly provides an implementation of the methods `build_model` and
`perform`.

The `build_model` method updates a record using the operation's parameters. See
section *Parameter extraction for create and update* for more information on
that.

The `perform` method saves the record using `save!`.

```ruby
class Operations::User::Update < RailsOps::Operation::Model::Update
  schema do
    req :id
    req :user do
      opt :first_name
      opt :last_name
    end
  end

  model ::User
end
```

As this base class is very minimalistic, it is recommended to fully read and
comprehend its source code.

As with `Create` operations, the `perform` method can be overwritten at your
liking.

### Destroying models

For destroying models, you can use the base class
{RailsOps::Operation::Model::Destroy} which is an extension of the `Load` base
class.

This class mainly provides an implementation of the method `perform`, which
destroys the model using its `destroy!` method.

```ruby
class Operations::User::Destroy < RailsOps::Operation::Model::Destroy
  schema do
    req :id
  end

  model ::User
end
```

As this base class is very minimalistic, it is recommended to fully read and
comprehend its source code.

### Parameter extraction for create and update

As mentioned before, the `Create` and `Update` base classes provide an
implementation of `build_model` that assigns parameters to a model.

The attributes are determined by the operation instance method
`extract_attributes_from_params` - the name being self-explaining. See its
source code for implementation details.

### Model authorization

While you can use the standard `authorize!` method (see chapter *Authorization*)
for authorizing models, RailsOps provides a more convenient integration.

#### Basic authorization

Model authorization can be performed via the operation instance methods
`authorize_model!` and `authorize_model_with_authorize_only!` (see chapter
*Authorization* for more information on the difference between these two).

These two methods provide a simple wrapper around `authorize!` and
`authorize_only!` that casts the given model class or instance to an active
record object. This is necessary if the given model class or instance is a
(possibly anonymous) extension of an active record class for certain
authorization backends to work. Therefore, use the specific model authorization
methods instead of the basic authorization methods for authorizing models.

If no model is given, the model authorization methods automatically obtain the
model from the instance method `model`.

#### Automatic authorization

All model operation classes provide the operation instance method
`model_authorization` which is automatically run at model instantiation (this is
done using an `:on_init` policy). The purpose of this method is to perform an
authorization check based on this model.

While you can override this method to perform custom authorization, RailsOps
provides a base implementation. Using the class method
`model_authorization_action`, you can specify an action verb that is used for
authorizing your model.

```ruby
class Operations::User::Load < RailsOps::Operation::Model::Load
  model User

  # This automatically calls `authorize_model! :read` after operation
  # instantiation.
  model_authorization_action :read
end
```

Note that using the different model base classes, this is already set to a
sensible default. See the respective class' source code for details.

### Model nesting

Using active record, multiple nested models can be saved at once by using
`accepts_nested_attributes_for`. While this is generally supported by RailsOps,
you may want to consider saving nested models using their own operation.

For this case, RailsOps' create and update model operations provide the method
`nest_model_op`.

```ruby
class Operations::User::Create < RailsOps::Operation::Model::Create
  schema do
    opt :user do
      opt :name
      opt :group_attributes
    end
  end

  model ::User
  nest_model_op :group, Operations::Group::Create
end

class Operations::Group::Create < RailsOps::Operation::Model::Create
  schema :group do
    opt :name
  end

  model ::Group
  nest_model_op :group, Operations::Group::Create
end
```

In this example, the parent operation `Operations::User::Create` automatically
instantiates a `Group::Create` operation and passes all the parameters to it
that the parent operation received under `group_attributes`. The group is saved
first. If this is successful, the user is saved.

Note that this feature only works with `belongs_to` associations with `autosave`
set to `false` and is not compatible with `accepts_nested_attributes_for`:

```ruby
class User
  belongs_to :group, autosave: false
end
```

#### Custom parameters

In the above examples, all `group_attributes` are automatically passed to the
sub operation. To customize this further, provide a block to the `nest_model_op`
method:

```ruby
nest_model_op :group, Operations::Group::Create do |params|
  params.merge(custom_override: :some_value)
end
```

This block receives the params hash as it would be passed to the sub operation
and allows to modify it. The block's return value is then passed to the
sub-operation. Do not change the params inplace but instead return a new hash.

Controller Integration
----------------------

While RailsOps certainly does not have to be used from a controller, it
provides a mixin which extends controller classes with functionality that lets
you easily instantiate and run operations.

### Installing

Controller integration is designed to be non-intrusive and therefore has to be
installed manually. Add the following inclusion to the controllers in question
(usually the `ApplicationController` base class):

```ruby
class ApplicationController
  include RailsOps::ControllerMixin
end
```

### Basic usage

The basic concept behind controller integration is to instantiate and
potentially run a single operation per request. Most of this guide refers to
this particular use case. See section *Multiple operations per request* for more
advanced solutions.

The following example shows the simplest way of setting and running an
operation:

```ruby
class SomeController < ApplicationController
  def some_action
    run! Operations::SomeOperation
  end
end
```

### Separating instantiation and execution

In the previous example, we instantiated and ran an operation in a single
statement. While this might be feasible for some "fire-and-forget" controller
actions, you might want to separate instantiation from actually running an
operation.

For this reason, RailsOps' controller integration is designed to always use
a two-step process: First the operation is instantiated and assigned to the
controller instance variable `@op`, and then it's possibly executed.

In the following example, we do exactly the same thing as in the previous one,
but with separate instantiation and execution:

```ruby
class SomeController < ApplicationController
  def some_action
    # The following line instantiates the given operation and assigns the
    # instance to `@op`.
    op Operations::SomeOperation

    # The following line runs the operation previously set using `op` using
    # the operations `run!` method. Note that `run` is available as well.
    run!
  end
end
```

The methods `run` and `run!` always require you to previously instantiate an
operation using the `op` method.

This can be particularly useful for "combined" controller methods that either
display a form or submit, i.e. based on the HTTP method used.

```ruby
def update_username
  # As above operation extends RailsOps::Model, we can already access op.model
  # (i.e. in a form) without ever running the operation. Therefore, we
  # instantiate the operation even if it is a GET request.
  op Operations::User::UpdateUsername

  # In this example, the operation is only run on POST requests.
  if request.post? && run
    redirect_to users_path
  end
end
```

### Checking for operations

Using the method `op?`, you can check whether an operation has already been
instantiated (using `op`).

### Model shortcut

RailsOps conveniently provides you with a `model` instance method, which is a
shortcut for `op.model`. This is particularly useful since this is available as
a view helper method as well, see next section.

### View helper methods

The following controller methods are automatically provided as helper methods
which can be used in views:

- `op`
- `model`
- `op?`

It is very common to use `model` for your forms:

```
= form_for model do |f|
  - # Form code goes here
```

### Parameters

As you've probably noticed in previous examples, we did not provide any
parameters to the operation.

Per default, the `params` hash is automatically provided to the operation at
instantiation. To be more precise: The params hash is filtered not to include
certain fields (see {RailsOps::ControllerMixin::EXCEPT_PARAMS}) that are most
commonly not used by operations (e.g. the `authenticity_token`).

This is achieved using the private `op_params` method. Overwrite it to your
needs if you have to adapt it for the whole controller.

Alternatively, you can pass entirely custom params to an operation via the `op`
method:

```ruby
op SomeOperation, some_param: 'some_value'
```

You can also combine these two approaches:

```ruby
# This example takes the pre-filtered op_params hash and applies another, custom
# filter before passing it to the operation.
op SomeOperation, some_param: op_params.slice(:some_param, :some_other_param)
```

### Authorization ensuring

For security reasons, RailsOps automatically checks after each action whether
authorization has been performed. This is to avoid serving an action's response
without ever authorizing.

The check is run in the `after_action` named
`ensure_operation_authorize_called!` and only applies if an operation class has
been set.

Note that this check also doesn't apply if the corresponding operation uses
`without_authorization` (see section *Disabling authorization* for more
information on this).

### Context

When using the `op` method to instantiate an operation, a context is
automatically created. The following fields are set automatically:

- `params` (as described in subsection *Parameters*)
- `user` (uses `current_user` controller method if available, otherwise `nil`)
- `ability` (uses `current_ability` controller method if available, otherwise `nil`)
- `session` (uses the `session` controller method)
- `url_options` (uses the `url_options` controller method)

### Multiple operations per request

RailsOps does not currently support calling multiple operations in a single
controller action out-of-the-box. You need to instantiate and run it manually.

Another approach is to create a parent operation which calls multiple
sub-operations, see section *Calling sub-operations* for more information.

Operation Inheritance
---------------------

Caveats
-------

### Eager loading in development mode

Eager loading operation classes containing models with nested models or
operations can be very slow in performance. In production mode, the same process
is very fast and not an issue at all. To work around this problem, make sure you
exclude your operation classes (i.e. `app/operations`) in your
`config.eager_load_paths` of `development.rb`. Make sure not to touch this
setting in production mode though.
