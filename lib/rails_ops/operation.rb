  # For illustration of potential use cases, consider the following example:
  #
  #     class User::Create < RailsOps::Operation::Model::Create
  #       def perform
  #         super # Saves the user
  #
  #         model.some_field = 'some value'
  #         model.save! # Throws validation error
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  #     User::Create.run(user: { some: :values })
  #
  # Since this operation is run without the bang method, validation errors are
  # caught and won't result in the transaction beeing rolled back. However, the
  # `super` call already saved the user while the exception happens only at
  # the manual call to `model.save!`. Thus the user will still be in the DB,
  # despite the fact that the second update didn't run.
  #
  # The correct example would therefore be:
  #
  #     class User::Create < RailsOps::Operation::Model::Create
  #       def perform
  #         super # Saves the user
  #
  #         with_rollback_on_exception do
  #           model.some_field = 'some value'
  #           model.save! # Throws validation error
  #         end
  #       end

  # elegant and transparent approach as explained in the issue.
